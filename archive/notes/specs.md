In a video, I want to be able to show a keyboard to demonstrate the shortcuts. However, different students have different keyboards. I want to create an interactive keyboard that you can customize to your own layout, so that it will show the keys that you need to press.

This will require a JSON file where the props are the character to type, and the values are the keyboard locations that you need to press.

Use <iframe> in the MarkDown to embed the HTML page.
Create different pages for different keyboard layouts, with the appropriate screenshots.
